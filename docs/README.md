Hi! There's a couple sections on this site, the most interesting right now is probably the one just below this paragraph. It will give you a short tutorial on how to construct commands, and later delves into how to use the bot in practice, with several examples of when to use it, and how to use it.

There's also more technical sections on this site, detailing how the commands exactly work.
