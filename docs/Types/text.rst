Text
====================

This type is one of the simplest available and straight-forward to use.
Text can contain a series of any character you can find, from letters to numbers to punctuation.
Special characters like Japanese or Chinese ones or emojis are also permitted.

Text ends when the next argument starts, or when the command all-together ends.
