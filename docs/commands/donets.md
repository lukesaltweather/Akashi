# $donets

## Description

Use this when you've finished your typeset. It will automagically message the next person in line, or will tag the appropriate role if it can't find a staffmember. Will assign the command executor as typesetter, if the chapter hasn't had a typesetter assigned already.

## Permissions

Requires role `Neko Worker`.

## Parameters

### Required

`-link=` The link to the files of the chapter you just completed.

`-p=` The project's title.

`-c=` The chapter's number.

#### Alternatively:

`-id=` Select chapter by ID instead of using `-p=` and `-c=`.

### Optional

`-note=` Add a note.
