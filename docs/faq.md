# Frequently asked questions

## Can I break things?

As an admin, absolutely, yes. Otherwise, things can be fixed with relative ease. Don't worry too much, but reviewing the command you're about to send is always a good idea. If you're unsure of how a certain parameter was called, try using `$help <your command>`. This will send a brief manual of the command.

## How can I get help? What if I discovered something weird or a bug?

I'd appreciate it if you look up your problem on these docs first. If you still can't figure it out, just give me a ping. If you discover a bug, please do ping me, or, if you have a GitHub account, submit it [here.](https://github.com/lukesaltweather/Akashi)

## I have a suggestion for a cool new feature! 

Suggestions are always welcome! You can either message me about it, or request it [here.](https://akashi.kampsite.co/)

## What timezone does the bot use?

UTC/GMT.

## Can I see the code somewhere? Can I contribute?

Yes! Head over to my [GitHub.](https://github.com/lukesaltweather/Akashi) If you want to contribute, please send me a DM.

## It's so slow!

Yes, I'm aware. The way it's written is highly inefficient, and a lot of the code is blocking. This will change at some point, the next major goal is a complete performance overhaul.

## Can I use this bot for my own group?

Yes, of course! However, do note that you'll have to host all of it yourself. It was also written to fit our specific needs. No, I will not rewrite it for you. No, I'm not your tech support. If you find a bug, please report it on my [GitHub.](https://github.com/lukesaltweather/Akashi)
