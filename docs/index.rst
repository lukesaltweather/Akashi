Akashi is a Discord Bot for managing scanlation workflows.
It keeps track of chapters, project and staff working on these.
Akashi was developed with my Scanlation Group, `Nekyou` in mind, so it's very tailored to our workflow.
On this site you can find documentation for Akashi's commands, as well as some info if you're interested in hosting your own instance.
